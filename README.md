# PortfolioManager
I got an idea for this program first when I tried to explain beta and alpha to my mom who is a keen investor but does not know anything about the more technical terms
of investing such as alpha, beta or sharpe ratio. This program uses a graphical interface that helps its user's to see their portfolio's alpha, beta and sharpe ratio.
In addition, users can see their portfolio value, daily single stock returns and they can sell and buy stocks too.

This program uses pandas, numpy, PyQt, yfinance, pickle, statsmodels and datetime libraries.
